# LOD Server Support

Streams LOD (Level of Detail) chunk data from your server to connected clients, so [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) can render terrain hundreds of chunks out — including terrain the player has never visited.

Supports **Fabric** clients, and **Fabric**, **Paper**, **Purpur** and **Folia** servers.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is the Minecraft 26.1.x support branch** (`support/mc26.1-v0.10` — the fresh v0.10.0
> re-port; it supersedes the frozen v0.8.0-era `support/mc26.1`). Releases from here are
> tagged `v<x.y.z>+mc26.1`; the Minecraft 26.2 mainline lives on `main`.

**Try it live:** join `lod-server-support.modrinth.gg` (Minecraft 26.2) with [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) and this mod installed.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LSS goes on **both** the server **and** every client. Clients also need [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) and Fabric API.

| | File | Goes in | Config generated at |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fabric client** | `lod-server-support-fabric.jar` | `mods/` | `config/lss-client-config.json` |
| **Fabric server** | `lod-server-support-fabric.jar` | `mods/` | `config/lss-server-config.json` |
| **Paper / Purpur / Folia** | `lod-server-support-paper.jar` | `plugins/` | `plugins/LodServerSupport/lss-server-config.json` |

Restart after installing. Downloads are on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lod-server-support); GitHub Releases mirror every version.

## Version Compatibility

Each Minecraft version has its own build, versioned `v<x.y.z>+mc<version>`; only the latest of each is listed. Folia uses the same JAR as Paper (experimental).

| Minecraft | LSS Version | Fabric | Paper | Folia | Voxy | Java |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **26.2** | v0.9.0+mc26.2 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0.2.17-alpha+ | 25+ |
| **26.1.x** | v0.8.1+mc26.1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0.2.14-alpha+ | 25+ |
| **1.21.11** | v0.8.1+mc1.21.11 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 0.2.15-beta+ | 21+ |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Mixed versions are fine back to v0.4.x.** LSS translates between protocol versions in both directions, so old clients keep working against new servers and vice versa. Against anything older — or with the compat layers turned off — you simply get vanilla render distance and no error.

## How It Works

Voxy on its own can only build LOD data from chunks the client has already loaded, so distant terrain appears only where the player has been. LSS moves that work to the server: the client asks for the chunks it wants, the server reads them from disk (generating them if they don't exist yet) and streams the raw section data back, and Voxy renders it. The server then pushes updates as chunks change, so distant terrain stays current.

## Commands

**Server** — `/lsslod stats` for per-player transfer statistics, `/lsslod diag` for detailed diagnostics. With the LOD store: `/lsslod store status` (state, hit/miss counters, size), `/lsslod store invalidate all` (drop every stored column — they re-warm from normal serves), and on Fabric `/lsslod store backfill start|stop|status` to control the background pre-warm walk. Requires operator status (Fabric: gamemaster level; Paper: the `lss.admin` permission, default op).

**Client** (Fabric only) — `/lss clearcache` re-requests every chunk, `/lss diag` shows connection and throughput, `/lss trace` toggles a debug log under `logs/`.

## Configuration

Config is generated on first run at the paths in the install table above. The generated file documents **every** setting; the ones most worth knowing are:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable LOD distribution |
| `lodDistanceChunks` | `512` | Max LOD distance in chunks |
| `mbPerSecondLimitPerPlayer` | `15.0` | Per-player bandwidth cap in MiB/s (decimals like `12.5` work), counted **before** compression |
| `mbPerSecondLimitGlobal` | `60.0` | Total bandwidth cap across all players in MiB/s, counted **before** compression |
| `enableChunkGeneration` | `true` | Generate missing chunks on demand, so players see terrain nobody has visited |
| `generationConcurrencyLimitGlobal` | `40` | Max chunks generating server-wide at once |
| `generationConcurrencyLimitPerPlayer` | `40` | Max concurrently generating chunks per player |
| `lodStore` | `"on"` | Keeps a compressed copy of every served LOD column in `<world>/lss-lod/` and serves repeat requests from it — far less CPU and disk work per chunk. The cost: it roughly doubles your world folder. `"off"` disables it. See **Tuning** |
| `lodStoreBackfill` | `true` | Pre-warms the store with a low-priority background walk of your existing world, so the first player to arrive already gets fast serves. Inert unless `lodStore` is on. Yields to players, pauses under load, resumes across restarts. Fabric only |
| `lodStoreMaxMB` | `0` | Size cap for the store. `0` = uncapped; set a value to bound it, and the oldest columns are evicted first |
| `enableV16Compat` | `true` | Serve legacy v0.4.x–v0.6.x clients through a built-in translation layer. `false` requires every client to match the server's protocol |
| `enableV18Compat` | `true` | Serve v0.7.x–v0.8.x clients natively — a full session, minus only the features their client predates. `false` drops them to the `enableV16Compat` fallback |
| `enableV19Compat` | `true` | Serve v0.9.x clients natively. `false` drops them to the `enableV16Compat` fallback |
| `xrayObfuscation` | `"auto"` | Anti-xray masking for LOD data. `"auto"` mirrors your anti-xray engine's own hidden-block list and height cutoff whenever one is detected (Paper's built-in, per world; the DrexHD AntiXray mod on Fabric). `"on"` forces masking, `"off"` disables it — LOD data then carries real ore locations even on anti-xray servers |
| `xrayHiddenBlocks` / `xrayMaxBlockHeight` | ore list / `64` | Fallback list and Y cutoff, used only when no engine settings can be adopted |

Masking applies to columns served after it activates — columns already cached by clients are not recalled, as with any anti-xray retrofit. Cave shapes and lighting are not hidden, matching packet-level anti-xray.

Older config files keep working unchanged: the byte-denominated `bytesPerSecondLimitPerPlayer` / `bytesPerSecondLimitGlobal` keys are still honored (the `mb*` keys win if both are present) and migrate to the new keys on the next start, and `"lodStore": "full"` means the same as `"on"`.

### Tuning

**Disk: the LOD store.** It ships on because it is the biggest performance win available — repeat requests are served from `<world>/lss-lod/` for a fraction of the CPU and disk work. The cost is that a fully warmed store roughly doubles your world folder. If that's too much, `lodStoreMaxMB` bounds it (oldest columns evicted first, re-warmed on demand), or `"lodStore": "off"` disables it. It is derived data — deleting `lss-lod/` while the server is stopped is always safe.

**CPU: the bandwidth and generation limiters.** LSS's cost is essentially how many columns per second it serves plus how many chunks it generates:

- `mbPerSecondLimitPerPlayer` / `mbPerSecondLimitGlobal` bound the serve rate. They count **uncompressed** data on purpose, so compression doesn't quietly raise the real ceiling.
- `generationConcurrencyLimitGlobal` / `generationConcurrencyLimitPerPlayer` bound generation — by far the most expensive thing LSS can trigger, since it is worldgen. On a server exploring fresh terrain, lowering these is the single biggest saving; `enableChunkGeneration: false` removes it entirely.

Lowering either costs *speed*, not correctness: LOD fills in more slowly, nothing breaks.

**Old clients cost more.** Serving outdated LSS clients makes the server do extra translation work and forgoes the current protocol's efficiency wins. If everyone on your server runs a current client, setting `enableV16Compat`, `enableV18Compat`, and `enableV19Compat` to `false` can improve performance — players on old versions then simply get vanilla render distance.

**Network compression.** Vanilla deflates every packet above `network-compression-threshold`, including LSS's already-compressed column frames — measurable overhead for almost no size win. Don't raise the global threshold to avoid it (vanilla chunk bandwidth pays far more than you save); if it matters, terminate compression at a proxy like Velocity instead.
